<h2>Memory - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-memory.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Memory on small devices is very limitted. So watch the memory use of applications over time if you encounter strange issues.</div>
<h2>CPU - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-cpu.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">On handheld and other devices all applications and driver share the same CPU(s). As the OS running on the devices is mostly a pre-emptive Multitasking one, each application and software should not consume more processor time than absolutely needed. If a process or thread uses the CPU for a longer period, other processes and threads will not run and the device will run slowly. CPU monitor or processor usage logs helpd you to identify the processes that use the most CPU time.</div>
<h2>Bluetooth - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-bluetooth.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

If a device is connected to a Bluetooth wireless device, the connection may break or disconnected by demand. To see what happens on the device during a Bluetooth connection you may use a Bluetooth Notification logging tool. For more detailed informations about failing or disconnecting Bluetooth devices there are also expensive Bluetooth sniffer hardware and software products.</div>
<h2>General - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-general.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If a device behaves strange with or without a custom application running you need some logging of what happens on the device side. A good application will provide logging and so does the OS itself. To get the logging information of the device you may need a special tool to enable and record these OS information in addition to the logs written by a custom application.</div>
<h2>CPU-<a class="button-link" href="./cat-cpu.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">WLAN is a wireless network connection and these may fail for various reasons. To analyze network issues you may use a network analyzer or tracing tool like wireshark on the customers network or a device-side tool like MS NetworkAnalyzer.</div>
<h2>WLAN - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-wlan.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">WLAN is a wireless network connection and these may fail for various reasons. To analyze network issues you may use a network analyzer or tracing tool like wireshark on the customers network or a device-side tool like MS NetworkAnalyzer.</div>
<h2>WWAN - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-wwan.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

WWAN connections like GSM, CDMA and similar may fail for different reasons. The OS mostly shows very generic error messages. To be able to analyze WWAN issues in more details, there are logging tools like RGLogger or WWANCollector. These tools record the driver functions and messages on the device side for further analysis.</div>
<h2>Utility - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-utility.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

Utilities are small tools to solve one customer need like converting a file or getting device informations.</div>
<h2>Battery - <a class="button-link" href="./cat-battery.html">Go</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

      Small devices come with small batteries.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You may need to analyze the battery use over time to be able to increase the total run-time possible using one battery pack.
