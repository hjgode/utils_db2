<h1>DevHealth</h1>
<br>Microsoft DevHealth is a tool to dump the current memory map into a text-like file. There is also a viewer which runs on a Windows PC.<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">DevHealthViewer for OEM only.</span></div>
    DevHealth takes some time to dump the memory map into a file. So it is only useful for static analysis. The dump file lists all DLLs and processes with there memory usage and can be used to identify low memory conditions.<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Copy DevHealth.exe onto a ARMv4i based Windows Mobile/CE device.</p>
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<p>Just start DevHealth.exe using mobile file explorer. Depending on the device taking the VM snap shot may take a long time (1-3 minutes). The screen will show the wait symbol until DevHealth has finished.</p>
<p>When finished you will find a new mem_x.txt on the first non-volatile volume (normally Flash File Store), where x is file counter which increments on every use.</p>
<h2>OUTPUT</h2>
<ul>
<li>See sample\mem_1.txt. A list with all processes and there DLL use and linkage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ADDENDUM</h2>
<p>See ReadMe.txt for further use.</p>
<p>Use DevhealthViewer to get a graphical view of the VM snap shot.</p>
