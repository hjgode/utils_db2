<h1>NetValidate</h1>
<h2>PURPOSE</h2>
<p>GSM data connectivity issues are being reported on the Dolphin 70e WEH and either low-level Sierra logging data is required or remedial action is required in terms of resetting the connection and/or the modem itself</p>
<p>NetValidate optionally starts the Sierra logging tool, monitors the connection state via the registry or the RIL directly and can also PING a list of host addresses. When a specified error count and/or timeout has been reached, the Sierra logging tool  is stopped and the files it has produced are zipped, and/or the connection or modem is reset. All configuration data is contained in an XML file.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The configuration xml needs to be customized for every single case.</p>
<p>Please contact Paul for a customized version</p>
