  <body><h1>DebugLog</h1>
<h2>PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Provide a device debug log for analysis if a device behaves strange over time or in general.
Debug logs contains data about what happens on the device and when. The analysis depends on the issue you see on the device.</p>
<p>Problem: Debugsave data is required to diagnose an issue but cannot be collected from the device in time before it is overwritten.</p>
<p>Solution: DebugLog accumulates the debugsave data in files, one for each day. Because the files can become very large, files older than 3 days are automatically deleted. This will still allow Friday’s file to be retrieved on Monday morning.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install the CAB file to the device and reboot. Alternatively, copy the CAB file to \IPSM\Honeywell\AutoInstall and perform a factory reset</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>The debugsave data for each day is written to a file called DebugLog_yyyymmdd.log where yyyymmdd is the date whose data the file contains. These files will be created in the root of “Storage Card” if an SD card is present, or in \IPSM if not. Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because data is written to the file once per minute, if an event is observed for which the debug data needs to be viewed then wait at least one minute before copying today’s file from the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each time DebugLog is started, it copies the whole debugsave buffer to the current output file. This means that if the device is rebooted, the file will contain duplicate entries. Stuart’s debug log viewer utility can automatically remove these duplicates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>The installer to copy the CAB file to a PC for use outside of the company and the CAB file itself for internal use can be found here:</p>
