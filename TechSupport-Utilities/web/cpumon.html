  <body><h1>cpuMon</h1>
<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>Windows Mobile &gt;= 6</p>
<h2>PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Analyze slow running or acting device. With the cpuMon CPU processor usage logging tool you can analyze and log the Processes and Threads consuming the most CPU time. If a process or thread consumes many CPU time it will slow down the device operating or even nearly stop the device.</p>
<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>Copy cpumon.exe and cpumon.txt onto the ARMv4i mobile device.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Option 1: adjust settings inside CpuMon.txt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option 2: copy and install CPUMon.CAB on the device. cpuMon is installed to \Program Files\Intermec UK\CPUMon and a links are placed in Start-&gt;Programs and \Windows\StartUp. There will be also a link for "Stop CPUmon".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<p>If installed via the CAB file either reboot after installation or use the links in Programs to start or stop CPUmon.</p>
<p>If installed manually, just start cpuMon.exe using mobile file explorer. Optinally and paste a link to cpuMon.exe inside the \Windows\StartUp folder.</p>
<p>To stop CPUmon.exe run StopCpuMon and StopFlush.</p>
<p>Logfiles are named</p>
<pre><code>yyyyMMddhhmmssCPUMon.txt
yyyyMMddhhmmss.clg
</code></pre>

<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
<p>With the default setup the log file is saved to \My Documents\<datetime>.CpuMon.txt with <datetime> being the date and time when CPUMon was started.
The log file updated every 5 seconds, see default config.</datetime></datetime></p>
<p>CPUMon will monitor CPU usage and highlight any threads using too much CPU time. By default it will log at  5s intervals and warn if a thread takes more than 1250ms i.e. 25% in that period. CPUMon.cab also contains Microsoft's "CELog" tool modified/configured to capture Process, Thread and Loader events. It will record when threads start, including information on thread ID and start address. It also logs the load address of all modules (exe, dll) as well. Taking the output of both CPUMon and CELog should allow us to see if any threads are using a lot of CPU time and also figure out which exe or dll contains the code for that thread.</p>

<p>The first number after a date+time entry is the ticks between the snapshots.
Each process is noted with number of threads and percentage of cpu usage.
Each line ends with the cpu idle time and the number of processes encountered.</p>
<p>Processes using more than the defined treshold level will be listed separately. For example:
2015-04-17 14:56:54 WARNING: thread 96622F7A used 2021 ms [iexplore.exe]</p>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>Look at the numbers and compare them for each process over time to identify processes using the most processor time.
Watch the CPU idle time at end of each line. Lower numbers may indicate a slow running device.</p>
<h2>DEFAULT CONFIG</h2>
<pre><code>;Intermec UK CpuMon settings
;LogFileDir specifies where where CPUMon logs are stored
LogFileDir=\My Documents
;LogInterval specifies how often CPU usage is logged in seconds
LogInterval=5
;InitialDelay specifies initial delay before logging starts in seconds
InitialDelay=0
;LogToDebugger is a boolean that specifies whether log lines are also written to system debugger
;Note: Visual Studio does not appear to handle long lines via it's debugger?
LogToDebugger=N
;WarningThreshold specifies threshold in milliseconds for warning about thread CPU usage
;i.e. CPUMon will add entry into log when a thread uses more than WarningThreshold ms CPU time
;during any one LogInterval period. Omit or specify zero to disable the warning.
WarningThreshold=1250
;WarningSound specifies an optional .wav file to play if WarningThreshold is exceeded
;Omit or leave blank to disable the sound
WarningSound=\Windows\lobeep.wav
